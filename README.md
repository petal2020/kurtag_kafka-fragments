data sets for performance analyses of György Kurtág’s *Kafka-Fragmente* (1985–87) for Soprano and Violin.

This repository introduces the data sets created during research on recorded performances of György Kurtág’s *Kafka-Fragmente* (1985–87). It complements the following three articles:

**main content** [in progress]

The data are presented here as **one [Excel file](Kurtag_Kafka-Fragmente_total_data.xlsx)** that includes data referring to the whole cycle and **40 further Excel files** (Kurtag_Kafka-Fragmente_**xx**_data.xlsx) that include data referring to the 40 individual movements of Kurtág’s cycle. The most important data for the whole cycle and for each movement are also provided as **tsv**-files separately. The duration data refer to sections and segments indicated in an annotated score of this work that has been published in open access at https://phaidra.kug.ac.at/o:107318.

**data content**

--Kurtag_Kafka-Fragmente_discography.xlsx (also available as .tsv): a complete discography of the published and unpublished recordings of Kurtág’s *Kafka-Fragmente* that were analyzed.

--Kurtag_Kafka-Fragmente_total_data.xlsx: This Excel file contains **4 worksheets** of data covering the entire cycle of 40 movements. 
* 'KF-dur_raw data' presents the raw duration data of all 40 movements in 14 recordings in seconds with colored scaling of values (green=low, yellow=mid, red=high) for each movement. Maximum, minimum, and mean values as well as relative standard deviation and relative range (maximum and miniumum values relative to the mean) are provided on the basis of all **14 recordings** and a subgroup of **8 recordings** in which every performer is represented only once (with the exception of András Keller who recorded the work with two different sopranos).
* 'KF-dur+perc 14' presents the same duration values and and statistical values of all 14 recordings with durations rendered in a min:sec format; it also identifies those recordings that have the minimum and maximum duration in each movement; the percentage of the toal duration is provided for each movement along with max, min, mean, absolute standard deviation, and absolute range values. Durations and percentages are presented


**glossary**

dur: duration/durations
perc: percentage/percentages (of total duration) 
mean: mean (average) value
max: maximum value
min: miniumum value 
abs stdv: absolute standard deviation
rel stdv (%): relative standard deviation (%)
rel range + (%): relative range + (%) – percentage of maximum value in relation to mean value
rel range - (%): relative range - (%) – percentage of minimum value in relation to mean value
rel range (%): relative range (%) – range between minimum and maximum value as percentage of mean value
score: percentages of sections and segments have been calculated on the basis of the note values provided in the score incorporating fermatas
dev: (absolute) deviation
rel dev (%): relative deviation (%)
min: minute(s)
sec: second(s)
part(s) (A, B, A'): formal units expressed with regard to similarity and difference/contrast of musical content
sec: section(s) (1, 2, 3…): larger form-dividing units
seg: segment(s) (1a, 1b, 1c): smaller form-dividing units
